# Hacker News Clone

Hacker News is a website where people from around the world share and discuss
websites and topics, generally about startups and technology.
It's a great way to stay up to date on ideas, trends, and news in the tech industry.
Hacker News has a great REST API, with documentation available here: https://github.com/HackerNews/API
Your challenge is to build a read-only clone of the hacker news frontend using that API.
